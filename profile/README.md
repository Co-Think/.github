## Problem Statement

As a citizen of local community, I encounter or hear about one or more problems in my community on a day to day basis via my daily chores. Just being aware of the problem makes me eligible to talk about it with others and if I am at a priviledged position of having knowledge or power in the governing system of the community, then I am even more eligible to discuss the problem and come up with suggestions on solving this.

In reality, an average citizen keeps the problems in his/her conversations only which never turn into an initiative for solving it. This is a huge loss of massive knowledge and what can be a community-driven, community-owned accountability. This loss, if prevented and captured, can bring a lot of order and removal of corruption into the system.

## How does community contribute to the problem

TLDR; - **By not participating.**

Most problems stay the way they are because of -

- Lack of its identification - Whether the problem is even a problem, or just a perception.
- Lack of knowledge of resources - Who is the owner and stakeholders of the problem, what rights do members have in a problem, what are the resources (available and needed) to solve the problem, what is the state of every stakeholder and resource etc.
- Lack of awareness - A very tiny percent of stakeholders are actually aware of the problem and asking for its remediation. This reduces the pressure the owners will feel for remediation.

## Solution

Essentially an idea crowdsourcing for hyper local communities.

### Overview

Launch a VOC (Voice of Citizen) system for local communities -

- It must work in a **bottom-up** manner - concerns come from community members directly.
- The concerns have to be preserved in a **curated** manner. Here curation is the selling-point of our proposal, social media and discussion forums allow everyone to raise concerns but no way to structure them in a way that it can organically evolve into rich information and can be used as a piece of proposal to discuss and act upon. Curation opens up the possibilities of collaboration and less dependency on the system, it essentially empowers the community to be in control.
- Problem oriented - Another difference between existing collaboration platforms and this proposal is that the VOC platform would be completely oriented and developed around a problem statement and the architecture needed for solving it in theory.

### Vision

The decisions of what needs to be prioritized should be within the hands of the community and not completely the other way round. The change should be bottom to up as much as it is top to bottom. The driving motto of our proposal is **"Local First, Global Next"**. Community needs to be concerned about and in control of their own local situation much more than the global ones.

> **Q.** Why make aware when no guarantee of change is there?

> **A.** Our understandings of change often remain in the shady realm of unstated assumptions, rather than being pulled out into the light of day for rigorous debate, scrutiny, and reflection. By remaining in the realm of unspoken assumptions, they (1) can render our strategies for change less effective and (2) can create tensions between agents of change who hold conflicting, yet unspoken ideas about change.

### Value-Addition

"Knowledge is power" - it is not entirely true but it is definitely not entirely false. 1% of members talking about a problem vs 10% of members talking about a problem makes a huge difference on the drive for its solution. VOC system will bring awareness and transparency for each problem in the community to each community member, putting a decentralised accountability enforcement on the governing system.
